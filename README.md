### @dev

##### Word of Warning to all would be warriors: Don't freak out and, don't touch anything.
```
- Python, Rust, Go, Swift, Node
- I run my own data-center(and have done so since 2015);
- Most repo's i've forked have probably been copied over to my own servers and rewritten to my liking.
- If you'd like access to these repos, all you have to do is ask.
- Highly curious, highly opinionanted, somewhat obnoxious.
