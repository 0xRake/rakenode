- Always Online.
- I run my own data-center(and have done so since 2015);
- Most repo's i've forked have probably been copied over to my own servers and rewritten to my liking.
- If you'd like access to these repos, all you have to do is ask.
- Highly curious, highly opinionanted, somewhat obnoxious.
